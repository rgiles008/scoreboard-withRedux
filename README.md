![Adding detail feature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13799534/44614393-f897a200-a7e0-11e8-9ab9-42622e57ee11.png)

## **Description**

Continuing on from my previous repo which I shouldve just merged but I added the a details feature for each player using javascript template literal
to add date of when the player was created or updated.  In the code I added a Player Detail file with new jsx to add the styling to the container. 
there is new props usage as to target the new selectPlayer and be able to select individual players to see details and seperate the functionality
of clicking the player to remove them.
